# Psnodig

A general transpiler with options for pseudocode and flowcharts. It was developed in conjunction with my master's thesis. \

Psnodig has a parser for the following languages:
- Gourmet

Psnodig has a writer for the following formats:
- Gourmet
- Python
- Pseudocode
- Flowcharts

The flowchart writer is a prototype, as it still struggles with complex programs (particularly the presence of nested control flow statements).
