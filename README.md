# Psnodig

Psnodig is a transpiler with writers for pseudocode and flowcharts, developed in conjunction with my master's thesis.

This repository contains both the [Psnodig source code](https://github.com/sergiosja/Psnodig) and the [thesis itself](https://github.com/sergiosja/Psnodig/tree/master/thesis).
