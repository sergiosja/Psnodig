\chapter{Implementation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Which tools am I using?
    \item Concrete implementation of the Psnodig tool
    \item Testing: How can I be certain that Psnodig works?
\end{itemize}

on its own, psnodig is useless! but when paired with parsers and writers, we see its magic. without, you can only but admire its conciseness and love it.

interpreter. what is the point? you see, not all syntactically correct programs are necessarily also semantically correct (cool graphs on this?? figures of some sort??). show an example!

btw (still on interpreter). this gives yet another edge compared to manually writing pseudocode. it is like JVM: write once, run everywhere! except not quite, but at least you can run the same code you transpile, before bothering to transpile it! if you write bubble sort, try it with a carefully (or perhaps not so) selected list, and it fails to sort your example list, then you probably shouldnt transpile it and use in your class, or present in a final masters thesis. \hfill \\

mention some kind of testing with quickcheck, e.g. from gourmet to ast and back to gourmet, to show consistency at least.
