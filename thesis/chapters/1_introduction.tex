\chapter{Introduction}

Pseudocode is commonly used for providing a description of an algorithm at a suitable level of abstraction. It is meant to work as a comprimise between a low-level implementation in a specific programming language, and a verbal, natural language description of a problem solution \cite{LinfoAlgorithmsIntro2007}. \hfill \\

An advantage of pseudocode is the lack of standardisation, therefore authors are not tied down to the syntax of any particular programming language. This gives them complete freedom to omit or de-emphasize certain aspects of their algorithms. Consequently, pseudocode is first and foremost aimed to serve as a tool for presentation [kilde?]. \hfill \\

However, as pseudocode is not executable, there is no omniscient way of verifying its correctness. This can, in turn, lead to accidental inclusion of critical inaccuracies. % especially when working with algorithms one is less acquainted with.
When writing code in IDEs, programming languages are often accompanied by static analysis tools that detect anti-patterns and warn about practices \cite{linter}. Psudocode writers, on the other hand, are left to their own devices, as there can be no anti-patterns or bad practices without standardisation.

\section{Motivation}

Correct presentations are especially important in academia, where the goal is to teach students concepts they were previously unfamiliar with. Traditionally, concepts within the algorithms and data structures realm have proved challenging for undergraduates \cite{10.1145/2157136.2157148}. If then additionally their first impression of an algorithm is an incorrect presentation, their path is already hampered. \hfill \\

In this thesis we present a tool we call \textbf{Psnodig} (pronounced snoo-dee), which allows for transpiling executable code to other, perhaps less technical presentations. The presentation targets in this thesis are pseudocode and flowcharts. The target audience is students who are already familiar with some imperative programming language syntax, like Go or Python. \hfill \\

The reader might be familiar with the concept of \textit{compiling}. Traditionally, this is a process where a \textit{compiler} reads a program in a high-level language and translates it to an executable target program \cite{DBLP:books/aw/AhoSU86}. \hfill \\

Transpiling however, in this context, is the act of translating a program to another program, whilst maintaining a similar level of abstraction. An example can be to transpile a program written in Python to an equivalent program in Rust, for performance optimisation reasons \cite{DBLP:conf/samos/LunnikiviJ020}. \hfill \\

The positive effect of teaching algorithms with flowcharts as an alternative to traditional code has been researched since at least the 1980's and is still being researched this decade \cite{DBLP:journals/software/Scanlan89}\cite{7096016}\cite{flowchartsHighschool}, yet direct translation from source code to flowcharts does not seem to be widespread. \hfill \\

We spend much more time reading code than we do writing code\cite[14]{martin2008clean}, and tools like IDEs and linters can only help us so much long term when it is the logic of our programs that we fail to grasp. We believe that the Psnodig tool can be an alternative for both authors wanting to present their algorithms, as well as students wishing to get a better understanding of them.

% Mention MAINTAINABILITY. For once, doing this shit by hand means we must maintain all (e.g. source code, psueodocode and flowcharts) "by hand". But now we don't have to anymore!

\section{Research Questions}

In this thesis, we aim to answer the following research questions: \hfill \\

\begin{quote}
    \textbf{RQ1:} Can we transpile source code to pseudocode whilst maintaining a similar level of abstraction?

    \textbf{RQ2:} Can we transpile source code to flowcharts whilst maintaining a similar level of abstraction?

    \sout{\textbf{RQ3:} Can people in academia find such a tool to be helpful in better understanding small-to-medium sized code chunks?} Keep, replace or remove entirely?
\end{quote}

(så er spørsmålet: hvor enkelt er det egentlig å skulle måle dette? hva vil det i det hele tatt si å ha similar level of abstraction?)

\section{Contributions}

The main contribution of this thesis is the Psnodig tool for transpiling executable source code to various other only versions of said code, giving people in academia an easy and accessible way of looking at their code from a different perspective. By using the Psnodig tool, we hope people can spend more time writing code and less time mastering LaTeX libraries, writing boilerplate and worrying about consistency. \hfill \\

The Psnodig tool is written entirely in the Haskell programming language\footnote{https://www.haskell.org/}. The tool comes with a parser for the Gourmet programming language, which offers a syntax rich enough for writing all algorithms and data structures introduced in the introductory course to algorithms and data structures at the University of Oslo\footnote{https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/ifi/IN2010/index-eng.html}. It is also accompanied by a Gourmet writer, as well as writers for pseudocode and flowcharts in LaTeX, utilising the Algorithm2e package\footnote{https://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithm2e} and the TikZ package\footnote{https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/TikZ\_package} respectively. \hfill \\

To summarise, the contributions include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Psnodig, a tool for transpiling code from one representation to another. Also comes with an interpreter which works on the intermediate abstract syntax tree (AST) representation, so that you can run your code.
    \item The Gourmet programming language, inspired by Go and Python, as a proof of concept. This includes a parser for converting tokens to an AST, as well as a writer to convert the AST back to Gourmet code.
    \item A writer for presenting ASTs with text based pseudocode, utilising the Algorithm2e package in LaTeX.
    \item A writer for presenting ASTs with flowcharts, utilising the TikZ package, also in LaTeX.
\end{itemize}

\section{Chapter Overview}

\textbf{Chapter 2} provides a clear definition of pseudocode which we carry with us for the remainder of the thesis, as well as some background on transpiling. \hfill \\

\textbf{Chapter 3} breaks down the exact problem we are looking at, in addition to analysing selected tools which already offer some of the functionality we aim to contribute with. \hfill \\

\textbf{Chapter 4} delves further into how we intend to solve the problem we introduce in the previous chapter, and compares our tool to what we believe are the shortcomings of its competitors. \hfill \\

\textbf{Chapter 5} provides concrete implementation details of Psnodig. \hfill \\

\textbf{Chapter 6} covers how we evaluated Psnodig, how it really works in practice, strengths, weaknesses, and how we attempted to make sure it actually works as intended. \hfill \\

\textbf{Chapter 7} discusses how the solution holds up agains the problem, and whether or not it fills the holes we believe exist in the alternatives. \hfill \\

\textbf{Chapter 8} concludes the work of this thesis, discussing the research questions and future work.

\section{Project Source Code}

All the source code from the master thesis can be found on Github\footnote{https://github.com/dashboard} (NOTE: nå ligger den på uio enterprise-githuben. burde være mulig å overføre den til github.com slik at den forblir tilgjengelig også etter at jeg leverer oppgaven og mister uio-rettighetene :smilefjes:).
