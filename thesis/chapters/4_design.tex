\chapter{Design}
\begin{itemize}
    \item This is how I intend to solve the problem! % perhaps here is where I mention stuff like #-stmts and @-stmts?
    \item Builds on the analysis chapter
\end{itemize}

THIS is where I start showing examples of how Psnodig is superior etc. In the problem analysis part, I only showcase what I believe lacks in Pseudogen etc.
