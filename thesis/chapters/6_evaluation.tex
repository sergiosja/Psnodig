\chapter{Evaluation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Use cases
    \item Examples of how it works in practice
    \item Strengts, weaknesses etc.
    \item Maybe: Test it on students that take/have taken IN2010? let them write algorithms and let the transpiler do the work
    \item How easy is it to add another reader/writer? How few lines can this be done in?
\end{itemize}

This should probably be divided into more parts? Like \\

Part I - Psnodig \\
Part II - Gourmet (+ parser?) \\
Part III.I - Latex-writer (algorithm2e) \\
Part III.II - Flowcharts (tikz)


when showing flowchart, maybe huge stuff is a bad idea. but we can try to show things like fizzbuzz and fibonacci!
