abstract = {We describe the first results of our work towards a concept inventory for Algorithms and Data Structures. Based on expert interviews and the analysis of 400 exams we were able to identify several core topics which are prone to error. In a pilot study, we verified misconceptions known from the literature and identified previously unknown misconceptions related to Algorithms and Data Structures. In addition to this, we report on methodological issues and point out the importance of a two-pronged approach to data collection.},
